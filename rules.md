1. **Be respectful**. Avoid heated arguments, name-calling, or any form of intentional negativity. Refrain from excessive pinging, especially directed towards staff. If you encounter issues with another member, reach out to a moderator for assistance.
2. **Keep it PG-13**. Mind your language and refrain from sharing explicit or sexual content. Our server welcomes members of all ages and backgrounds, aiming to maintain a comfortable environment in all public chat channels.
3. **Avoid political discussions** that are not directly relevant to wiki topics. This includes discussions about politics, politicians, and related topics that do not have a clear connection to the wiki's subject matter.
4. **Use common sense**. While these rules provide guidance, not every situation may be explicitly covered. When in doubt, seek clarification from a moderator in ‚Å†<#1127445997614801006> or <#1127436166828933140>.
5. **Utilize the appropriate channels** for discussions. <#563022855516717071> is designated for wiki-related chat, <#563024520101888010> for off-topic conversations. It's important to note that these named channels are examples, and you should read the channel descriptions before engaging in conversation to ensure alignment with the intended topic and purpose of each channel. Specific wiki verticals (e.g., gaming, anime, movies, TV) have their own channels for focused discussions.
6. **Maintain a recognizable nickname or username**. Your nickname or username should be recognizable as your Fandom username while allowing for reasonable adjustments. If one is set, the other can be anything you prefer. This ensures clarity and transparency in communication. Use the </nick:948489810736189440> command from <@908978035338936360> for any necessary modifications, ensuring your Fandom username remains evident.
7. **Discussions about tickets**. If a discussion requires actions or insights beyond the capabilities of this server's members, it should be redirected to Staff [via a ticket](https://support.fandom.com/). While advice-seeking is permitted, any matters where assistance cannot be provided by the server's members should be directed accordingly. The members of this server cannot address on-platform issues such as wiki closure, ban, admin abuse, and so on. To contact Fandom Staff members, please submit a ticket. For any instances of [vandalism](https://c.fandom.com/Help:Vandalism) or [spam](https://c.fandom.com/Help:Spam), please report them in <#866305196573327370>.
